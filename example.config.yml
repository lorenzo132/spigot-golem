# Copper Golem Sorter Configuration
# Configure how copper golems sort items from copper chests to normal chests

# Transfer speed settings
transfer:
  # Items transferred per operation (every tick the golem processes)
  # Higher = faster item transfer
  # Default: 4 items per operation
  items-per-operation: 4

  # Ticks between transfer operations (20 ticks = 1 second)
  # Lower = faster transfers, Higher = slower transfers
  # Default: 20 (1 second between operations)
  ticks-between-transfers: 20

  # Movement speed multiplier for golems when carrying items
  # 1.0 = normal speed, 1.5 = 50% faster, 0.5 = 50% slower
  # Default: 1.2
  movement-speed: 1.2

# Carrying capacity settings
capacity:
  # Maximum number of item stacks a golem can carry at once
  # Default: 9 (equivalent to one row of inventory)
  max-stacks: 9

  # Maximum total items a golem can carry (across all stacks)
  # Set to -1 for unlimited (only limited by max-stacks)
  # Default: 576 (9 stacks * 64 items)
  max-total-items: 576

# Detection range settings
range:
  # Maximum distance (in blocks) a golem will detect copper chests
  # Default: 16
  copper-chest-detection: 16

  # Maximum distance (in blocks) a golem will detect normal chests for sorting
  # Default: 24
  normal-chest-detection: 24

# Sorting behavior
sorting:
  # Enable automatic item sorting by type
  # true = items are organized by material type
  # false = items are placed in any available slot
  # Default: true
  enabled: true

  # Prevent overfilling chests
  # true = golem will not transfer items if destination chest is full
  # false = golem may attempt to transfer even if chest is full
  # Default: true
  prevent-overfill: true

  # Stack similar items together before transferring
  # true = combine partial stacks of same item type
  # false = transfer items as-is
  # Default: true
  stack-items: true

# Priority system (optional)
# Items listed here will be sorted first when multiple item types are available
# Use Bukkit Material names (e.g., DIAMOND, IRON_INGOT, EMERALD)
priority-items:
  - DIAMOND
  - EMERALD
  - NETHERITE_INGOT
  - GOLD_INGOT
  - IRON_INGOT

# Performance settings
performance:
  # Maximum number of golems that can be active simultaneously
  # -1 = unlimited
  # Default: 50
  max-active-golems: 50

  # Enable debug messages in console
  # Default: false
  debug: false
